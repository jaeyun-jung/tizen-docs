# Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) inference feature introduces how you can easily invoke the neural network model and get the inference output result effortlessly and efficiently.

You can use the following machine learning feature in your .NET applications:

- [SingleShot](singleshot.md)

  You can use the `Tizen.MachineLearning.Inference.SingleShot` class, to load the existing neural network model or your own specific model from the storage. After loading the model, you can invoke it with a single instance of input data. Then, you can get the inference output result.

- [Pipeline](pipeline.md)

  You can also use the `Tizen.MachineLearning.Inference.Pipeline` class to manage the topology of data and the interconnection between processors and models.

  Note that, this feature is available in the .NET APIs from Tizen 6.0.
